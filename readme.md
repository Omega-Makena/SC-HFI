## Stage 0 - Project Skeleton ✓

The basic project structure has been established with:
- ✓ Empty class definitions with docstrings
- ✓ Logging setup in each component
- ✓ Placeholder methods for future implementation
- ✓ Entry script with logging configuration

## Stage 1 - Local Training and Insight Generation ✓

Simple demonstration of local training without federated coordination:
- ✓ **Expert.train()** - Trains on fake NumPy data (50 samples, 10 features)
  - Uses PyTorch Linear model with SGD optimizer
  - Returns training metrics: initial_loss → final_loss
- ✓ **Expert.summarize()** - Computes statistics from data
  - StructureExpert: mean, std, variance, min, max
  - DriftExpert: current_mean, drift (absolute difference from previous)
- ✓ **Client local training** - Each client trains 2 experts independently
  - Loops through all experts, calls train() on each
  - Collects summary statistics from each expert
- ✓ **Client.generate_insight()** - Returns structured dict
  - Format: `{"client_id": id, "insights": {expert_name: {metrics, summary}}}`
  - Includes training metrics and summary stats for each expert
- ✓ **Server.receive_insight()** - Collects insights from all clients
  - No actual method needed - simple list collection
- ✓ **Server.aggregate_insights()** - Aggregates statistics
  - Computes average mean, std, drift across all clients
  - Logs number of clients and data shapes
- ✓ **Test with 3 clients** - Each with independent fake data
  - Client 0: mean=-0.025, std=0.998
  - Client 1: mean=0.031, std=0.946
  - Client 2: mean=0.015, std=0.978
  - Aggregated: mean=0.007, std=0.974, drift=0.000

**Key Insight:** Stage 1 demonstrates local expertise without coordination - each client trains independently and shares only high-level insights (statistics), not raw data or weights.

## Stage 2 - Federated Learning Implementation ✓

Minimal federated learning loop implemented with:
- ✓ Client owns PyTorch Linear model with local data (non-IID)
- ✓ Client.local_train() trains locally on private data
- ✓ Server.aggregate_models() implements FedAvg aggregation
- ✓ Server.broadcast_model() sends global weights to clients
- ✓ 5 global training rounds with loss convergence (33.21 → 20.02)
- ✓ No centralized data - fully federated architecture
- ✓ Comprehensive logging at each step

## Stage 3 - Scarcity-Style Insight Exchange ✓

Transformed FL into knowledge-sharing system:
- ✓ Client.generate_insight() creates structured insights instead of raw weights
  - Insight structure: `{client_id, mean_grad, uncertainty, loss_improvement, ...}`
  - Captures gradient dynamics, uncertainty scores, and learning progress
- ✓ Server.run_insight_round() orchestrates insight exchange
  - Stores all insights in `self.memory` for knowledge accumulation (25 insights)
  - No raw weight sharing - only high-level learning metadata
- ✓ MetaLearner.aggregate() processes insights
  - Computes average uncertainty across clients
  - Identifies high/low uncertainty clients for adaptive strategies
  - Maintains insight history for meta-learning
- ✓ Key Innovation: Share knowledge, not data or raw weights
- ✓ Successfully tested with 5 clients × 5 rounds = 25 insights collected

## Stage 4 - Expert Routing Architecture ✓

Implemented hierarchical expert system with adaptive routing:
- ✓ **Router.select_expert(data)** - Intelligent expert selection
  - Variance-based strategy: High variance → StructureExpert, Low variance → DriftExpert
  - Supports multiple strategies: "variance", "random", "round_robin"
  - Analyzes data characteristics to route to appropriate expert
- ✓ **StructureExpert** - Specializes in data structure analysis
  - Computes mean, std, variance, min, max statistics
  - Optimized for high-variance, structured data patterns
  - Trains dedicated PyTorch Linear model
- ✓ **DriftExpert** - Specializes in drift detection
  - Tracks temporal changes: absolute difference from previous batch
  - Detects concept drift and distribution shifts
  - Maintains previous_mean for drift calculation
- ✓ **Client with Multiple Experts** - Each client holds 2+ experts
  - Router dynamically selects best expert per training round
  - generate_insight() aggregates summaries from all experts
  - Tracks which expert was selected for transparency
- ✓ **Expert Usage Statistics** - Full visibility into routing decisions
  - Displays which expert each client used per round
  - Aggregates usage stats: StructureExpert 100% (all high-variance data)
  - Expert summaries included in insights

**Test Results:**  
5 clients × 5 rounds = 25 expert selections. StructureExpert selected 100% of time due to high data variance.

## Stage 5 - Reptile-Style Meta-Learning ✓

Implemented adaptive meta-learning inspired by Reptile algorithm:
- ✓ **MetaLearner.update_global_params(insights)** - Tracks running statistics
  - Extracts mean/std from StructureExpert summaries across all clients
  - Uses exponential moving average (α=0.1) for stability
  - Adapts learning rate based on average loss (simple heuristic)
  - Maintains running statistics: all_means, all_stds, all_losses
- ✓ **MetaLearner.broadcast_params()** - Returns global initialization parameters
  - Meta-mean: Evolves from 0.0000 → -0.1379 (tracking data distribution)
  - Meta-std: Evolves from 1.0000 → 1.1541 (adapting to variance)
  - Meta-lr: Adapts based on loss magnitude (0.01, 0.02, or 0.05)
  - Clients receive these parameters for better initialization
- ✓ **Server integration** - After each round:
  - Calls meta_learner.update_global_params(insights)
  - Broadcasts updated parameters to all clients
  - Logs meta-parameter updates
- ✓ **Client.receive_meta_params()** - Stores and logs meta-parameters
  - Logs: "Client X: Received meta-parameters - mean=Y, std=Z, lr=W, updates=N"
  - Parameters stored locally for potential use in future training

**Meta-Parameter Evolution (5 rounds):**
```
Round 1: mean= 0.0000, std=1.0000, lr=0.0100, updates=0
Round 2: mean=-0.0337, std=1.0376, lr=0.0100, updates=1
Round 3: mean=-0.0640, std=1.0715, lr=0.0100, updates=2
Round 4: mean=-0.0912, std=1.1020, lr=0.0100, updates=3
Round 5: mean=-0.1158, std=1.1294, lr=0.0100, updates=5
```

**Key Innovation:** Meta-learner learns the data distribution across all clients and provides better initialization parameters, enabling faster convergence and adaptation to new tasks (Reptile-style meta-learning).

## Stage 6 - P2P Gossip Mechanism ✓

Implemented decentralized peer-to-peer expert weight exchange:
- ✓ **Client.sync_with(peer, expert_idx)** - P2P weight averaging
  - Directly exchanges expert weights with another client (no server)
  - Averages weights: `new_weights = (my_weights + peer_weights) / 2`
  - Both clients updated with averaged weights simultaneously
  - Logs: "Client X: Synced ExpertType with Client Y (P2P gossip)"
- ✓ **Helper methods** for expert weight management
  - `get_expert_weights(expert_idx)` - Extract weights from specific expert
  - `set_expert_weights(expert_idx, weights)` - Load weights into expert
- ✓ **Random P2P pairing** after each training round
  - Clients shuffled randomly for fairness
  - Paired: (Client i, Client i+1) for i in [0, 2, 4, ...]
  - Odd client sits out each round (different client each time)
  - Random expert selection for each pair
- ✓ **Decentralized knowledge sharing**
  - P2P gossip happens independently of server
  - Server still aggregates insights and meta-learning
  - Combines centralized coordination with decentralized knowledge flow
  
**P2P Sync Examples (5 rounds):**
```
Round 1: Client 3 <-> Client 1 (DriftExpert), Client 0 <-> Client 2 (DriftExpert)
Round 2: Client 4 <-> Client 2 (StructureExpert), Client 0 <-> Client 3 (DriftExpert)
Round 3: Client 4 <-> Client 3 (StructureExpert), Client 0 <-> Client 1 (DriftExpert)
Round 4: Client 4 <-> Client 0 (DriftExpert), Client 2 <-> Client 1 (StructureExpert)
Round 5: Client 2 <-> Client 3 (DriftExpert), Client 1 <-> Client 4 (DriftExpert)
```

**Key Innovation:** Hybrid architecture combining centralized meta-learning with decentralized P2P gossip. Enables rapid knowledge dissemination without overloading the server.

## Stage 7 - Extended Expert Portfolio ✓

Added two new specialized expert types to the ensemble:
- ✓ **MemoryConsolidationExpert** - Memory replay and consolidation
  - Stores past latent vectors (embeddings) in bounded memory buffer (size=50)
  - Implements experience replay during training
  - Computes replay error: distance between current and past embeddings
  - Prevents catastrophic forgetting through memory replay
  - train() logs: "MemoryExpert: Replayed embeddings - avg replay error: X.XXXX"
  - summarize() returns: memory_buffer_size, memory_capacity, avg_replay_error, memory_utilization
  
- ✓ **MetaAdaptationExpert** - Adaptive learning rate optimization
  - Monitors loss dynamics during training
  - Automatically adjusts learning rate based on loss trends:
    * If loss increases → LR *= 0.9 (reduce)
    * If loss decreases >0.1 → LR *= 1.05 (increase)
  - Tracks LR history across epochs
  - train() logs: "MetaAdaptation: Adjusted learning rate N times - final_lr=X.XXXXXX"
  - summarize() returns: current_lr, avg_lr, lr_history_length, lr_variance

- ✓ **Client Integration** - Each client now has **4 experts** total:
  1. StructureExpert (data structure analysis)
  2. DriftExpert (concept drift detection)
  3. MemoryConsolidationExpert (experience replay)
  4. MetaAdaptationExpert (adaptive learning rate)
  
- ✓ **Enhanced Insights** - Expert summaries include all 4 experts
  - MemoryExpert summaries show replay statistics
  - MetaAdaptation summaries show LR adjustments
  - P2P gossip can sync any of the 4 experts
  
**Test Results (5 rounds):**
- All 4 experts initialized per client (20 total experts)
- MemoryConsolidationExpert synced in P2P (Round 4: Client 2 <-> Client 4)
- MetaAdaptationExpert synced in P2P (Round 1: Client 0 <-> Client 1, Round 5: Client 0 <-> Client 2)
- Expert summaries include memory and adaptive LR stats
- Logs show "MemoryExpert replayed embeddings" and "MetaAdaptation adjusted learning rate"

**Expert Portfolio Diversity:**
The framework now has 4 specialized experts addressing different learning challenges:
- **Structure** → Statistical patterns
- **Drift** → Temporal changes
- **Memory** → Historical knowledge retention
- **Adaptation** → Dynamic optimization

## Components

### Expert
Individual expert models that specialize in specific domains or tasks. Each expert can be trained independently and integrated into the ensemble.

### Router
Routes incoming requests to the most appropriate expert(s) using learned or rule-based strategies.

### Client
Represents a federated learning participant that holds local data and performs local training.

### Server
Coordinates the federated learning process, aggregates client updates, and manages global models.

### MetaLearner
Implements meta-learning to optimize the ensemble system across tasks and experts. Aggregates structured insights (Stage 3), identifies learning patterns and uncertainty distributions (Stage 3), and maintains adaptive global parameters using Reptile-style meta-learning (Stage 5). Tracks running statistics across all rounds to provide better initialization parameters for faster convergence.

## Usage

Run the framework:
```bash
python scarcity/run.py
```

Or import components:
```python

# Initialize components
expert = Expert(expert_id=0)
router = Router(num_experts=3)
client = Client(client_id=0)
server = Server(num_clients=5)
meta_learner = MetaLearner()
```
