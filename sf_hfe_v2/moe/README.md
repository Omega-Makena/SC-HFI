# Scarcity Mixture of Experts (MoE) - Full System Architecture

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete 6-tier learning hierarchy that transforms experts from simple predictors into true data anthropologists. The system follows the philosophy: "Every new dataset is a new world. The first layer of experts must become anthropologists ‚Äî not engineers."

## Architecture Components

### üèÅ Entry Layer - Domain Router (Gate)
**File**: `gate.py`
- **Purpose**: First intelligence that client data meets
- **Function**: Recognizes data domain and activates relevant experts
- **Key Features**:
- Context extraction and domain scoring
- Expert activation decisions
- Feedback loop for routing improvement
- Support for economic, agricultural, medical, environmental, and social domains

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 1 - Structural Understanding
**File**: `tier1.py`
- **Purpose**: Data anatomy layer - learns what the dataset is
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Schema Detector: Infers data types and column roles
- Integrity Checker: Finds missing/outlier/duplicate patterns
- Distribution Modeler: Fits probabilistic summaries
- Stationarity Probe: Tests temporal stability
- Quality Indexer: Synthesizes data health score

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 2 - Relational Understanding
**File**: `tier2.py`
- **Purpose**: Builds relationship graph - how variables connect
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Correlation Mapper: Computes pairwise associations
- Dependency Graph Builder: Constructs directed/undirected graphs
- Latent Clusterer: Groups co-moving variables
- Interaction Detector: Finds non-linear relations
- Context Switch Tracker: Detects relationship reversals

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 3 - Dynamical Understanding
**File**: `tier3.py`
- **Purpose**: Learns temporal and adaptive behavior
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Trend-Cycle Analyzer: Decomposes series into trend/cycle
- Regime Detector: Finds shifts or break points
- Drift Classifier: Labels drift types
- Feedback Mapper: Tracks causal feedback
- Temporal Encoder: Builds time-aware embeddings

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 4 - Semantic Understanding
**File**: `tier4.py`
- **Purpose**: Extracts meaningful latent concepts
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Feature Importance Estimator: Ranks drivers of variance
- Latent Concept Builder: Learns abstract variables
- Causality Scorer: Confirms robust causal links
- Representation Learner: Creates domain-invariant embeddings

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 5 - Projective Understanding
**File**: `tier5.py`
- **Purpose**: Transforms insight into reasoning and forecasting
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Forecaster: Predicts next state
- Counterfactual Simulator: Tests interventions
- Uncertainty Estimator: Computes confidence and volatility
- Cross-Domain Adaptor: Transfers knowledge across domains

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 6 - Meta Understanding
**File**: `tier6.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides self-reflection and control
- **Sub-Experts**:
- Performance Auditor: Tracks loss variance and uncertainty
- Adaptation Controller: Adjusts hyper-parameters
- Expert Selector: Activates or retires experts
- Memory Consolidator: Preserves important weights

### üóÑÔ∏è Unified Storage
**File**: `unified_storage.py`
- **Purpose**: Single storage solution for both Federated Learning and MoE
- **Features**:
- Stores insight summaries instead of raw data
- Supports both federated learning and MoE insights
- Organizes by domain basket, tier, and timestamp
- Aggregates metrics and triggers Meta-Learning updates
- Thread-safe operations with bounded storage
- Supports data export/import and retention policies

### Simulation Engine
**File**: `simulation.py`
- **Purpose**: Independent component for testing and reasoning
- **Features**:
- Runs counterfactual and stress tests
- Generates synthetic scenarios and policy outcomes
- Feeds results back into Global Storage
- Supports multiple scenario templates

## Usage Example

```python
from moe import ScarcityMoE

# Initialize the complete MoE system
moe = ScarcityMoE(config={
'gate': {'activation_threshold': 0.5},
'tier1': {'focus': 'financial_metrics'},
'tier2': {'correlation_threshold': 0.3},
# ... other tier configurations
})

# Process data through the complete system
results = moe.process_data(data, metadata)

# Access results from each tier
structural_insights = results['tier1']
relational_insights = results['tier2']
dynamical_insights = results['tier3']
semantic_insights = results['tier4']
projective_insights = results['tier5']
meta_insights = results['tier6']

# Get system status
status = moe.get_system_status()
```
